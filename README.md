The purpose of this assignment was to get as comfortable as possible with the usage of lists by implementing a bunch data analysis algorithms using a doubly linked lists, these include eliminating exceptions, eliminating noise through 2 different methods, uniformization, completion of data and statistics. 

Usage: (Linux instructions, can be done on Windows as well slightly differently)
- use the make command
- give execution rights to the executable
- run the executable with the arguments of which operations you would like to apply in order (--e1, --e2, --e3, --u, --c and --st<delta> for the operations above in this order)
- input a number of elements and a timestamp and a value for each element
- the program will output the new list of elements after all operations have been applied
